	<p id="PaT">Richard Turner has ,also, won the Penn and Teller:Fool Us show <br>(the biggest TV show about magic in the world), managing to fool both Penn and Teller with his card tricks. <br> 
	The two magicians didn't even get to the point of trying to understand what the secret was<br> behind Turner's tricks. 
	At this show Penn and Teller -two great magicians of their own- invite some of the world's best magicians <br>and ask them to perform a trick for them.
	After the called-up magician performs his trick,<br> the two magicians try to understand how he did it. <br>If wrong, the magician wins the opportunity to later perform at one of Penn and Teller's Las Vegas shows.</p>
