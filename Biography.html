		<h1>Early Life</h1>
		<p>
			Turner was born in San Diego in 1954, which he dubbed "the year of the full deck" (referring to a standard 52-card deck of playing cards, plus the two jokers). His eyesight failed at the age of nine following his recovery from a bout with scarlet fever.<br><br> Turner attended a special school for the visually impaired in Santee, California, where he refused to learn Braille (and never has). His younger brother, David, had been taking karate lessons for nine months, and invited Turner to accompany him. He began karate lessons in 1971 under the tutelage of Master John Murphy, the United States' founder of Wado-Kai, a Japanese hard style karate and was good at it, and began training at Gene Fisher's Gym eventually earning a fifth degree black belt in Wado-Kai karate.<br><br> In 1972 Turner auditioned for a small, non-profit San Diego Christian theater operated by television actor Steve Terrell, and performed for six years with the "Lamb's Players". Terrell taught Turner how to look people in the eye so that they would not know of his visual impairment.<br> <br>He was later introduced to Bobby Yerkes, the stunt coordinator for the Wonder Woman television series who also trained celebrities for the show Circus of the Stars. Yerkes taught him to swing on the trapeze, walk a tight rope, and take high falls.

		<h1>Personal Life</h1>

		<p>
			Turner is married to Kim Turner (formerly Kim Miller) and they have a son named Asa Spades Turner.

			<br><br>When Turner was eleven years old he created a puzzle game called "Batty", inspired by the game Tower of Hanoi. In May 2011 he released his fourth version. Batty has eleven levels of difficulty ranging from an uncomplicated Level 3 through the extremely complex Level 11. While a Level 3 can be resolved by an elementary school student by making between 6 and 7 moves, mastering Level 11 demands far greater mathematical acumen, and requires between 1,023 and 2,047 moves without making a single mistake
